# friendFinders
This project is about somewhat similar to the dating apps. This app is built as full-stack. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js must be installed on local machine or host. See https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for instructions.
  
### Overview
1. The app folder structure is as shown below.

  ```
  FriendFinder
    - .gitignore
    - app
      - data
        - friends.js
      - javascript
        - survey.js
      - public
        - home.html
        - survey.html
      - routing
        - apiRoutes.js
        - htmlRoutes.js
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
  ```
2. The file `home.html` is the home page.
3. The file `survey.html` contains the user survey.
4. The server is created by the script `server.js` and it is designated as the start script. It requires the npm packages `express` and `path`.
5. The `htmlRoutes.js` file include two routes:
   * A GET Route to `/survey` which displays the survey page.
   * A default, catch-all route that leads to `home.html` which displays the home page.
6. The `apiRoutes.js` file contains two routes:
   * A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This is used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
   * A POST routes `/api/friends`. This is used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.
7. The `survey.js` file contains the event handing and POST routes to the apiRoutes.js.
